<h2>Project Management</h2>

For the Superstore Sales Performance Dashboard project, your GitHub repository serves as a powerful demonstration of both technical expertise and essential project management skills. By including key deliverables such as a comprehensive README that outlines the project's objective and features, a detailed Project Management Plan (which covers scope, timeline, and risks), a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), defined milestones, insightful questions that drove the analysis, and a thorough case study, you effectively showcase your ability to meticulously plan, organize, communicate, and deliver data-driven solutions, highlighting your full spectrum of capabilities beyond just code or visualization. This holistic approach provides stakeholders and potential employers with a clear understanding of your process and project execution prowess.
