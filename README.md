<b>Data Acquisition and Preprocessing: Unlocking Insights from Transactional Data</b>

Comprehensive transactional data, including order details, customer information, product specifics, sales, quantities, discounts, and profit margins, was utilized for analysis.



<h3>Key Features:</h3>

  - <b>Executive Summary:</b> A high-level overview of Superstore Inc.'s sales dynamics, highlighting total sales ($2.29 million) and profit ($286,397.02), and identifying core challenges like low profitability in specific product categories and regions despite high sales volumes.


  - <b>Detailed KPI Analysis:</b> In-depth examination of key performance indicators, including overall sales, profit, profit ratio (12.47%), total volume, and sales per customer, with breakdowns by customer segment and shipping mode.
    

  - <b>Segment & Regional Deep Dive:</b> Analysis of sales contributions by region (West and East as primary revenue drivers, South and Central comparatively lower). Identifies critical states like Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, which exhibit high sales volume but alarmingly low or negative profit margins. Explores customer segment performance, noting the Consumer segment leads in sales, while Home Office yields the highest profit ratio.


  - <b>Product/Category Profitability Review:</b> Pinpoints top-grossing sub-categories (Phones and Chairs). Crucially identifies sub-categories like Tables and Bookcases operating at significant losses, and Machines, Chairs, and Storage showing thin margins despite high sales.


  - <b>Trend & Seasonality Analysis:</b> Visualizes sales trends over time, revealing strong seasonality with peaks in the last quarter (September-December) influenced by holiday shopping, and dips in the first quarter (January-February).


  - <b>Actionable Recommendations:</b> Provides strategic interventions focused on optimizing pricing and product mix for low-profit, high-sales sub-categories, combined with targeted profitability initiatives in underperforming states. Outlines a structured implementation plan and expected outcomes for profit improvement.


  - <b>Tableau Visualizations:</b> Integrates key insights into intuitive and interactive Tableau dashboards and stories (details on creating these included in project documentation).
